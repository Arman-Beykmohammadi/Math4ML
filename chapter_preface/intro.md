# Introduction
In Machine Learning and Data Science, we often work with data that can be represented as vectors, matrices, or higher-dimensional arrays. These data structures are fundamental to many algorithms and techniques in these fields. Understanding linear algebra is crucial for working with these data structures and developing a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematical principles.
